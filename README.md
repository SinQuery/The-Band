### Commits Record
- [Com1] Basic boilerplate code.
- [Com2] Basic structure of the application. [Description] Addition of section tags & root styling elements. All page dimensions sorted. Navbar applied with list items for redirecting to respective pages.
- [Com3] Navbar scroll & redirect feature. [Description] Adding a fixed position for the navbar (not using 'fixed' though). Appylying redirect links to the navbar links, taking you to respective sections/pages
- [Com4] Positioned headings & div for Home & Band page. [Description]Manipulated positioning of the heading, paragraph, div tags of the Home & Band page to necessary positons. Added the font for the relevant elements.
- [Com5] Positioned other headings (3). [Description] Applied an alternative strategy, by using div's to encapsulate my child contents so that it is easier to manipulate position without compromising other external content (beyond section/page). Fixed the z-index of the navbar, as it was dissappearing behind the black sections. Applied new font and styling to the band section as well as the general body of text.
- [Com6] Applying the Dates div to Tour section. [Description] Applied the tour dates section with necessary styling. Changed up the positioning of the "sold" icon, as it looks a lot more presentable in the current position.


### Side-notes
- Image files are currently unavailable. Will work on compiling them overtime, using image search feature.
- Grouped CSS elements/tags into their respective areas (pages), please adhere to those for improved code visibility.
- I've centered the div's in two different ways. The Home section has one method, then the rest of the pages have another. The one I'd recommend is the latter (2) as it caters for more than just desktop screens (interoperable)
- Currently added a beige border for the div's. This serves as just a visual guide, and will not be present in the final product. Don't worry about it. Keep in mind that this div is temporary so don't be too concerned about div class (tourDiv) in wrong sections.


#### (Vuyile Task notes)
- Trying to manipulate the navbar to be in the same page range (100vh) as section tag. I've added a stash for the previous attempt in the same predicament. Also created a new branch that yuou're currently on for the section page.
- Do the next sections (3) headingDiv positionings then commit.
